# Air-Pollution-DashBoard

## Problem Statement

Air pollution poses severe health risks and environmental challenges across India. Monitoring and analyzing Air Quality Index (AQI) data is critical for identifying the most polluted cities and states, understanding pollutant composition, and taking informed policy actions. This project aims to visualize AQI data across various states and cities of India for 27th July, providing a comprehensive view of pollutant levels, state-wise trends, and city-specific hotspots.

## Overview of Dashboard
This interactive Power BI dashboard presents AQI statistics using various visuals, including:

Key Metrics Cards: Displays the maximum, minimum, and average pollution values.

Pollution Matrix (Donut Chart): Shows state-wise proportional distribution of AQI values.

Gas Ratio (Bar Chart): Highlights the percentage contribution of individual pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, OZONE, SO2, NH3).

City-wise Max Pollution (Horizontal Bar Chart): Ranks cities based on their maximum pollution readings.

State-wise Pollution (Dual Bar Chart): Compares minimum and maximum AQI levels for each state.

Detailed Table: Lists each state and city with their respective max and min AQI readings for quick lookup.

Filters: Allows dynamic selection of states and air pollutants for focused analysis.

## Insights from the Dashboard
Overall AQI Statistics:

Max Pollution: 500

Min Pollution: 1

Average Pollution: 26.69

Most Polluted City:

Agartala (Tripura) recorded the highest AQI of 500, along with Lucknow and Navi Mumbai also hitting the maximum reading.

Top Pollutants:

PM10 (58.48%) and PM2.5 (40.79%) are the dominant contributors to air pollution, followed by CO (28.39%).

NH3 has the lowest contribution (4.64%).

State Hotspots:

States like Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra show maximum AQI readings of 500 in certain cities.

Bihar has the lowest recorded AQI of 1 in some regions.

High Pollution Clusters:

Cities such as Agartala, Lucknow, Navi Mumbai, Sagar, and Noida are among the most polluted.

Many cities in Rajasthan and Maharashtra appear frequently in the top pollution list.

Pollution Variation:

Large variations in min and max AQI within a state suggest uneven pollution distribution, indicating localized sources of pollution.
